# CS5041-SpaceJunker

This repository demonstrates work completed as part of the **CS5041 Interactive Hardware And Software** module for Practical 1.
The purpose of this practical was to explore and demonstrate the use of both hardware and software interfacing with each other to create an 
interesting video game.

A video game, `**Space Junker**', has been created using Processing and BBC Micro:Bits. 
The game is multiplayer (2+ players, but single player is supported) and is controlled completely by Micro:Bits. 
The game combines a survival mode mechanic with competitive head-to-head; players are ‘Space Junkers’ who compete to collect satellite debris 
(for score) whilst dodging lethal asteroids (to avoid elimination).

Players use the tilt of their Micro:Bit to control an on-screen avatar fluidly and precisely. Additional inputs from the Micro:Bits support further game 
mechanics (e.g., player abilities) and quality of life features (e.g., player connection phase and pausing), culminating in an entertaining and polished 
experience. Several outputs are used meaningfully to enhance the game: speakers support immersive game sounds, individual player statuses are highlighted 
on their Micro:Bit LEDs, and servos provide passive haptic feedback.

This work has been documented in the provided _Report_, and the game is explained in the provided _Game Guide_.
